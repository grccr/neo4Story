### Neo4J

So, this project is inspired and based on graph database - Neo4J.

In this section some useful links for Neo4J preparing are provided.

Neo4J import and shell tools support different formats, and better way to choose **CSV**. 
It's easier to find, easier to serve, easier to run and easier to handle with [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html)
 or another tools.
   
#### Preparing of Neo4J.

If you still haven't Neo4J - it is time to install it!  
[Official Download page](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/) contains all that we need for it.

There is some recommendation here - use **tar** download for *Linux, Mac OS X* and **zip** for *Windows* - 
you will always know where is your Neo4J.
Package installers (deb, dmg, exe) are also OK, but there is no much flexibility.

#### Import data to Neo4J.

If we have CSV files - we will use [this guide](https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/)
If we have Neo4J dump - we will use [this load mechanism](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/dump-load/)
