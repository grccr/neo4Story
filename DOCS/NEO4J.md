### Neo4J

This project is inspired and based on graph database - Neo4J.

In this section some useful links for Neo4J preparing are provided.

Neo4J import and shell tools support different formats. In our mind **CSV** is best. 
It's easy to find, serve, run and handle with [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html)
 or another tools.
   
#### Preparing of Neo4J.

If you still haven't Neo4J - it is about time to install it!  
[Official Download page](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/) contains all that you need for it.

There is some recommendation here:
- **tar** download for *Linux* 
- **tar** or **brew** install for *Mac OS X* 
- **zip** for *Windows* 

Package installers (deb, dmg, exe) are also OK, but there is no much flexibility.

#### Import data to Neo4J.

- In case of CSV files - use [this guide](https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/)
- In case of Neo4J dump - use [this load mechanism](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/dump-load/)
